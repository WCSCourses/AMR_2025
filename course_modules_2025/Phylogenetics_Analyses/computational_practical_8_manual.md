## Introduction to phylogenetic analysis <a name="intro"></a>

**Phylogenetic analysis** is central to many areas of modern microbiological research, from pathogen classification to examination of pathogen-host co-evolution and tracking of transmission of infectious diseases. The main result from a phylogenetic analysis is a **phylogeny**, also known as **phylogenetic tree**, or simply a tree, depicting evolutionary relationships of a set of taxa â€“ these can be different species or different strains of the same species, as it is often the case in genomic epidemiology studies. **Figure 1** to familiarise with commonly used phylogenetic terminology (e.g., internal nodes, branches, etc,).
